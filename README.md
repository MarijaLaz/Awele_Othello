# Oware and Othello Board Games

This is a project realised for the course 2I013 at Sorbonne University. We were working on developing the two board games Oware and Othello. The full description of the project and the files can be found in the report [here](Project_Report_2I013.pdf). 

## Running the code
To run our code for both games you can use the following commands:

```python
cd Othello
python3 main.py
```

```python
cd Awele
